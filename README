 my-curses
===========

Program to illustrate a chat-like ncurses interface. It uses pthread conditionals to simulate sofware interrupt when the message is "received" by the Whisper session and communications service.

Instructions
------------

* Build the program with

    make

The executable is placed inside the build folder.

* Run the program with

    ./build/my-curses

* Type a message into the prompt and hit Enter. The message will appear in the output section.

* Type

    r/message 

  and hit Enter to simulate a message from a remote peer (printed in different colour).
  Obviously these mesage would be sent by the peer, but r/ flag is so that we can illustrate look and feel ideas without network noise.

* Type
 
    :q

  and hig Enter in the prompt to quit the program.
