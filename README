 my-curses
===========

Program to illustrate a chat-like ncurses interface. It uses pthread
conditionals to simulate sofware interrupt when the message is "received" 
by the Whisper communications service for a chat session.

Instructions
------------

* Build the program with

    make

The executable is placed inside the build folder.

* Run the program with

    ./build/my-curses

* Type a message into the prompt and hit Enter. The message will appear
  in the output section.

* Type

    r/message 

  and hit Enter to simulate a message from a remote peer (printed in 
  different colour).

  Obviously these mesages would be sent by the peer, but r/ flag is here so 
  that we can illustrate look and feel ideas without the network "noise".

* Type
 
    :q

  and hit Enter in the prompt to quit the program.
